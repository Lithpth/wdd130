                    <p>After the passing of Sir Charles Quandaledingle III, it left a hole in our family. He wasn't
                        related to us but he may as well have been. Due to his passing the only way I thought I could
                        cope with it was to make a rafting company. He always called me "daft" so I named the company
                        "Daft Rafts"</p>

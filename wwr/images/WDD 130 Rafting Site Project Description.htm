    <h2>The Whitewater Rafting Site Project Description</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>

      The Whitewater Rafting Site Project is a website project that will be built throughout the
      course. The goal of the project is to meet the course outcomes and objectives through
      development specifications that match learning activities and assignments. You will be
      involved in the planning, design, development, and deployment of your own whitewater rafting
      site. Some of the pages have more prescriptive requirements that others. There will be
      opportunities for you to demonstrate competency and your own creativity.</p>

      recreation where typically a non-motorized water craft
      floats and navigates down free flowing rivers. A rafting company organizes and manages trips
      which
      most often include experienced guides. The business intent is to provide a thrilling and safe
      experience to individuals and groups for a fee.</p>
